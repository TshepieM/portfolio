## ABOUT ME

👋 Hi! I'm Tshepisho Mphahlele, an Applied Mathematics graduate with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I recently completed a Full Stack Development certificate at the FNB App Academy, where I worked on team-based coding projects and built web apps from the ground up.

I'm currently diving deeper into data science — exploring machine learning, data storytelling, and research-driven projects that matter. Whether it's visualizing youth unemployment stats, modeling systems with Lie symmetries, or building dashboards, I'm always learning and experimenting. 

💡 **I believe in learning by doing**, and my GitHub is where I share what I’m learning and creating.

### SKILLS & TOOLS
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MATLAB
